# StockLevelPrediction_Grocery

## Problem Statement 

Gala Groceries is a technology-led grocery store chain based in the USA. They rely heavily on new technologies, such as IoT to give them a competitive edge over other grocery stores. 
They pride themselves on providing the best quality, fresh produce from locally sourced suppliers. However, this comes with many challenges to consistently deliver on this objective year-round.

Gala Groceries want help with a supply chain issue. Groceries are highly perishable items. If you overstock, you are wasting money on excessive storage and waste, but if you understock, then you risk losing customers. They want to know how to better stock the items that they sell.

The problem lies in **accurately predicting stock levels** on the data given by Gala Groceries in form of sales data and Sensor Data

## Exploratory Data Analysis

A sales.csv file was given, which I was analysed to correlate and plot the different dependencies in the data

**Product Id vs  Number of times they were ordered(Count)**

From this analysis it was summarised :
- More data was required to predict correlations accurately, this was just the data of one store for one week
- The current business problem is too broad, we should narrow down the focus in order to deliver a valuable end product
- More features were required
